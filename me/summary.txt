I am an AI engineering trainee with hands-on experience in machine learning, natural language processing, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Skilled in building agent-based systems using LangChain, LangGraph, and the OpenAI ecosystem, as well as deploying end-to-end prototypes using tools like Dify.AI. Currently contributing to a civic-tech research unit, where I develop autonomous workflows for document analysis and regulatory search. I’m passionate about building AI tools that are not only smart — but practical, ethical, and built for impact.
